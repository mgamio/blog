In the realm of computer science, data structures serve as the cornerstone of efficient and organized data manipulation. They provide a systematic framework for arranging and managing data, enabling programmers to access, modify, and process information with optimal performance. Data structures are fundamental to the development of software applications, from simple web pages to complex data-driven systems.

## Defining Data Structures

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, storing, and managing data. It encompasses the arrangement of data elements in memory, the relationships between them, and the operations that can be performed on them. Data structures are designed to optimize specific aspects of data manipulation, such as searching, sorting, insertion, and deletion.

## Types of Data Structures

A wide array of data structures exists, each tailored to handle different types of data and operations. Some of the most common data structures include:

-- **Arrays**: Store data elements in contiguous memory locations, offering efficient random access.

We usually declare a variable to store a specific value.

```kotlin
int num = 15;
```

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. To create an array of integers, you could write:

```kotlin
int[] myNums = {15, 22, 7, 42};
```

To create an array of strings that represent objects, you could write:

```kotlin
String[] objects = {"Bicycle", "Trophy", "Umbrella", "Guitar", "Hat"};
```

When you go to the bank for a Consultation, you receive a waiting ticket with a printed image. What you see in the display is an Array. Or rather, an array-based Queue.

![arrays](/assets/images/arrayBank.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

But the most probable is that these images come from an array of bytes.

```kotlin
private byte[][] images;
```

When your turn arrives, it is because the program retrieved an element from the array.

![arrayElement](/assets/images/arrayElementBank.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


> You should use an array when you need to store a fixed number of elements that are of the same type and size. -- <cite>codersite.dev</cite>



-- **Linked Lists**: Consist of nodes linked together, allowing for insertion and deletion operations without affecting other elements.

Here’s an example of how to use the LinkedList class:

```kotlin
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class LinkedListUseCase {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    LinkedList<String> objects = new LinkedList<String>();
    objects.add("Guitar");
    objects.add("Bicycle");
    objects.add("Radio");
    
    // Use addFirst() to add the item to the beginning
    objects.addFirst("Book");
    System.out.println(objects);
  }
}
```

The output:

```kotlin
[Book, Guitar, Bicycle, Radio]
```

Scenario:

- In a digital music service, Use a linked list to create a playlist to add or remove dynamically your favorite songs. If you have an array, inserting or deleting songs in the middle of the playlist would require shifting all the subsequent elements in the array, which is a time-consuming operation.

- In an e-commerce application, use a linked list to create a shopping list to hold frequently requested items.

- You might use a linked list to implement a stack, a queue, or a hash table.

-- **Stacks**: Treat data as a linear structure where items are added and removed from the top.

-- **Queues**: Treat data as a linear structure where items are added to the rear and removed from the front.

![queue](/assets/images/queueDef.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

<div>
{%- include primeVideo.html -%}
</div>

-- **Hash Tables**: Efficiently store and retrieve data using keys and values.

Here’s an example of how to use the Hashtable class:

```kotlin
import java.util.Enumeration;
import java.util.Hashtable;
 
public class HashTableUseCase {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Hashtable<Integer, String> articles = new Hashtable<>();

    // Adding elements to the hashtable
    articles.put(1, "link_article1");
    articles.put(2, "link_article2");
    articles.put(3, "link_article3");

    // Getting values from the hashtable
    String articleLink = articles.get(1);
    System.out.println("Link to article: " + articleLink);

    // Removing elements from the hashtable
    articles.remove(2);

    // Enumerating the elements of the hashtable
    Enumeration<Integer> keys = articles.keys();
    while (keys.hasMoreElements()) {
      Integer key = keys.nextElement();
      System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + articles.get(key));
    }
  }
}
```

Output:

```kotlin
Link to article: link_article1
Key: 3, Value: link_article3
Key: 1, Value: link_article1
```

-- [Trees](https://codersite.dev/tree-data-structure-binary-search-tree/){:target="_blank"}: Hierarchical structures that organize data in a tree-like pattern.

-- [Graphs](https://codersite.dev/graphs-depth-first-search/){:target="_blank"}: Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges.

When you solve a problem, it is a common practice to build a new data structure - Abstract Data Type - that combines all previous data structures.

For example, you can build a queue data structure using only two internal stacks.

```kotlin
public class QueueViaStacks<T> {
  Stack<T> inbox;
  Stack<T> outbox;
  
  //code omitted for brevity
}
```

## Significance of Data Structures

Data structures play a crucial role in computer science for several reasons:

- Efficient Data Access: Data structures enable efficient access to specific data elements, reducing the time and effort required for data manipulation.

- Memory Management: Data structures optimize memory usage by minimizing wasted space and ensuring that data is stored in a compact and organized manner.

- Problem-Solving Efficiency: Data structures provide efficient solutions to various computational problems, such as sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.

- Software Scalability: Data structures are crucial for developing scalable software applications that can handle increasing data volumes and usage.
