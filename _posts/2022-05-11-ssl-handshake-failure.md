The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) enables a secured connection between a client and a server. SSL Handshake is a set of steps that make it possible for this secured connection over the network.

A summary of the steps in the SSL handshake:

- Agree on the version of the cryptographic protocol to use.
- Select cryptographic algorithms - cipher suites to use.
- Exchange and validate digital certificates to authenticate each other.
- Generate a shared secret key using asymmetric encryption techniques.

For more information about cryptographic algorithms and digital certificates, refer [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/7.5?topic=mechanisms-cryptographic-security-protocols-tls-ssl){:target="_blank"}.

## Handshake Failure Scenario

We try to build a Spring WebClient component to consume data from an API Server (target_server).

Requisites:

- SDK: 1.8 java version "1.8.0_191"
- Websphere application server

```kotlin
String username="here_username_target_server";
String password = "here_password_target_server";

WebClient webClient = WebClient.builder()
  .baseUrl("baseUrl_target_server")
  .filter(basicAuthentication(username, password))
  .build();

Mono<String> monoString = webClient
  .get()
  .uri("uri_target_server").accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
  .retrieve()
  .bodyToMono(String.class).log();

logger.info(monoString.block());
```

Once the client is running, throws the following error.

```kotlin
ERROR WebClientRequestException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure; nested exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure)
```
<div>

</div>

## Analysis

We usually check if both parties - client and server - comply with all the steps of the Handshake mechanism.

When the client initializes, we see the following lines on the console.

```kotlin
15:11:23.567 [main] DEBUG io.netty.handler.ssl.OpenSsl - netty-tcnative not in the classpath; OpenSslEngine will be unavailable.
15:11:24.939 [main] DEBUG io.netty.handler.ssl.JdkSslContext - Default protocols (JDK): [TLSv1]
15:11:24.939 [main] DEBUG io.netty.handler.ssl.JdkSslContext - Default cipher suites (JDK): [TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA]

```

We can realize Client is using the **TLSv1** protocol

Now letâ€™s see on the server-side by using an OpenSSL command. (On Windows PC we can use Git Bash)

```kotlin
openssl s_client -connect <IP>:<PORT>
```

Now, we can see the response.

```kotlin
---
SSL handshake has read 5388 bytes and written 473 bytes
Verification: OK
---
New, TLSv1.2, Cipher is ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
Server public key is 4096 bit
Secure Renegotiation IS supported
Compression: NONE
Expansion: NONE
No ALPN negotiated
SSL-Session:
    Protocol  : TLSv1.2
    Cipher    : ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
```
<div>
{%- include inArticleAds.html -%}
</div>

The server is using the **TLSv1.2** protocol, that means Client and Server are not using the same protocol version.

## Solution

From the server response, some ciphers are not supported in the TLSv1.2 protocol.

We can upgrade java version but sometimes is not easy because many applications depend on WebSphere licenses, and we need to wait until the next release.

Once we have identified the supported Protocol and Cipher Suites supported by the server, we can modify the ones supported by the Client through the TLS configuration to be able to connect to the Server.

Or we can implement the following system property to our Client code.

```kotlin
System.setProperty("com.ibm.jsse2.overrideDefaultTLS","true");
```

We rerun the Client and see the console.

```kotlin
16:32:56.858 [main] DEBUG io.netty.handler.ssl.OpenSsl - netty-tcnative not in the classpath; OpenSslEngine will be unavailable.
16:32:58.106 [main] DEBUG io.netty.handler.ssl.JdkSslContext - Default protocols (JDK): [TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1, TLSv1]
16:32:58.106 [main] DEBUG io.netty.handler.ssl.JdkSslContext - Default cipher suites (JDK): [TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA]

```

Now Client and Server are agree on the SSL Handshake and can exchange data.
