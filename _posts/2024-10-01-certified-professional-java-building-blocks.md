## Answers to the Questions

1- D, E. Option E is the canonical main() method signature. You need to memorize it. Option D is an alternate form with the redundant final. Option A is incorrect because the main() method must be public. Options B and F are incorrect because the main() method must have a void return type. Option C is incorrect because the main() method must be static.

2- A, E.  Dog is a class, which can be seen from the declaration: public class Dog. The variable dog is a reference to an object. The method main() is the standard entry point to a program. Option G is incorrect because the parameter type matters, not the parameter name.

3- A, D, F.  Garbage collection is never guaranteed to run, making option F correct and option E incorrect. Next, the class compiles and runs without issue, so option G is incorrect. The Bear object created on line 8 is accessible until line 12 via the brownBear reference variable, which is option A. The Bear object created on line 9 is accessible via both the polarBear reference and the brownBear.pandaBear reference. After line 11, the object is still accessible via brownBear.pandaBear. After line 12, though, it is no longer accessible since brownBear is no longer accessible, which makes option D the final answer.

4- F.  To solve this problem, you need to trace the braces {} and see when variables go in and out of scope. The variables on lines 2 and 7 are only in scope for a single line block. The variable on line 12 is only in scope for the for loop. None of these are in scope on line 14. By contrast, the three instance variables on lines 3 and 4 are available in all instance methods. Additionally, the variables on lines 6, 9, and 10 are available since the method and while loop are still in scope. This is a total of 7 variables, which is option F.

5- C, E.  The first thing to recognize is that this is a text block and the code inside the """ is just text. Options A and B are incorrect because the numForks and numKnives variables are not used. This is convenient since numKnives is not initialized and would not compile if it were referenced. Option C is correct as it is matching text. Option D is incorrect because the text block does not have a trailing blank line. Finally, option E is also an answer since " # knives is indented.

6- E.  Options C and D are incorrect because local variables don't have default values. Option A is incorrect because float should have a decimal point. Option B is incorrect because primitives do not default to null. Option E is correct and option F incorrect because reference types in class variables default to null.

7- E.  The first two imports can be removed because java.lang is automatically imported. The following two imports can be removed because Tank and Water are in the same package, making the correct option E. If Tank and Water were in different packages, exactly one of these two imports could be removed. In that case, the answer would be option D.

8- A, C, D.  Line 2 does not compile as only one type should be specified, making option A correct. Line 3 compiles without issue as it declares a local variable inside an instance initializer that is never used. Line 4 does not compile because Java does not support setting default method parameter values, making option C correct. Finally, line 7 does not compile because fins is in scope and accessible only inside the instance initializer on line 3, making option D correct.

9- C, E, F.  In Java, there are no guarantees about when garbage collection will run. The JVM is free to ignore calls to System.gc(). For this reason, options A, B, and D are incorrect. Option C is correct as the purpose of garbage collection is to reclaim used memory. Option E is also correct that an object may never be garbage collected, such as if the program ends before garbage collection runs. Option F is correct and is the primary means by which garbage collection algorithms determine whether an object is eligible for garbage collection. Finally, option G is incorrect as marking a variable final means it is constant within its own scope. For example, a local variable marked final will be eligible for garbage collection after the method ends, assuming there are no other references to the object that exist outside the method.

10- A, D.  The first compiler error is on line 3. The variable temp is declared as a float, but the assigned value is 50.0, which is a double without the F/f postfix. Since a double doesn't fit inside a float, line 3 does not compile. Next, depth is declared inside the for loop and only has scope inside this loop. Therefore, reading the value on line 10 triggers a compiler error. For these reasons, options A and D are the correct answers.
