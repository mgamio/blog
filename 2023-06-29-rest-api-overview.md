APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable communication and data exchange between systems. Among the various types of APIs, [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer){:target="_blank"} (Representational State Transfer) has emerged as a popular architectural style for building web services. This article will delve into the fundamental concepts of REST API, its principles, and its significance in modern web development.

## What is an API?

An API is an interface with defined functionalities that a software program presents to other programs and, in the case of web APIs, to the rest of the world via the Internet.

APIs are the building blocks that allow interoperability between businesses on the web. APIs are how food data containing information about allergens are shared with hundreds of restaurant apps specializing in their presentation to final customers.

## What is REST API?

REST API is an architectural style that defines a set of guidelines for creating web services. It stands for Representational State Transfer and emphasizes a stateless, client-server communication model. REST APIs use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as the primary protocol for data transmission and rely on standard operations such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform actions on resources.

## Resources

In REST API, a resource is the information or data exposed through the web service. Resources can be entities such as users, suppliers, articles, or any other data entity that can be uniquely identified. Each resource on the Web is typically represented by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or endpoint defining a globally unique address.

In a business context, the following endpoint retrieves a representation of an array of article data under the following URL.

```
GET /api/v1/articles HTTP/1.1
Host: www.codersite.dev
```
